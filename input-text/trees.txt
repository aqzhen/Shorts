A binary tree is a tree such that every vertex has degree at most 3.
Usually we consider the tree to be rooted at some root vertex r.
The height of a binary tree is the number of edges in the longest path from the root node to a leaf.
Also, instead of considering the neighbors of vertices in a binary tree, we normally call them the left/right children.
